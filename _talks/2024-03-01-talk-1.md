I am organizing a series of talks by experts in the field. Our aim is, firstly, to help MSc students become familiar with the research being conducted in the city in the field of computational biology. Secondly, we aim to promote scientists and open-source bioinformatics tools. Thirdly, we want to facilitate networking and assist people in finding internships, master's theses, or eventually a PhD.
Also, I need to thank Maryam Abasi and Basecamp for their great hospitality and for allowing us to have meetings there.
