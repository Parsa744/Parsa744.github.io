Hello! My name is Parsa, and I work as a computational biologist and bioinformatician at the University of GÃ¶ttingen. I specialize in modeling biological networks, such as those found in the brain and embryos. If you're interested in a scientific discussion, want to know more about my educational journey, or have any other questions, please don't hesitate to reach out. I also organize some talks about bioinformatics, you can learn more about it here: https://parsa744.github.io/talks/2024-03-01-talk-1
