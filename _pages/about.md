#About me
Hello! My name is Parsa, and I work as a computational biologist and bioinformatician at the University of GÃ¶ttingen. I specialize in modeling biological networks, such as those found in the brain and embryos. If you're interested in a scientific discussion, want to know more about my educational journey, or have any other questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
