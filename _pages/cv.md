ABOUT ME
I am a dedicated computational biologist with expertise in bioinformatics, data science, and a strong emphasis on machine learning and computer vision. Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at the University of Göttingen, where I have developed advanced computational skills to tackle complex biological challenges.

At Göttingen, I worked as a Research Assistant in the Computational Neuroscience department, where I designed a deep learning-based smart system for microscopes. This innovation improved the performance and intelligence of the microscopes, enhancing the efficiency of biological data collection and analysis.

In my first semester, I excelled in the 'Data Science with Python' course, which led to my appointment as a Teaching Assistant (TA) in the following semester. As a TA, I supported students in mastering challenging concepts, contributing to their academic success.

My master’s thesis focuses on applying deep learning to microscopy images, particularly in cell segmentation and tracking using techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), diffusion models, and transformers. I am also exploring spiking neural networks in a side project, driven by a belief that current machine learning frameworks are nearing their limits and that new approaches are needed.

My interdisciplinary background in biology and computer science fuels my passion for developing innovative solutions at the intersection of these fields. I am eager to contribute to research efforts, advancing the frontiers of machine learning, computer vision, and computational biology.
