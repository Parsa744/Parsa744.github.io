The ISIC 2024 Challenge, hosted on Kaggle, focuses on skin cancer detection using advanced imaging techniques. This year's challenge is centered on the use of 3D Total Body Photography (3D-TBP) for detecting malignancies, providing participants with high-resolution images for training AI models to identify skin lesions.

Participants aim to build models that accurately classify skin lesions, distinguishing between benign and malignant cases. The primary evaluation metric is the partial Area Under the Curve (pAUC) for binary classification, specifically focusing on the range above 88% true positive rate. This ensures that models prioritize high sensitivity, which is critical for clinical applications where missing a malignant lesion could have serious consequences.

Additionally, secondary metrics include "top-15 retrieval sensitivity," which rewards models that can effectively rank the most high-risk lesions in a set of images for further examination. Another secondary metric assesses model efficiency, incentivizing computationally efficient solutions. This combination of metrics ensures both accuracy and practicality in real-world medical environments.

The challenge dataset consists of diverse skin lesion images captured using advanced modalities, including lighting, chroma, and color contrasts. These images enable models to learn detailed visual features crucial for identifying cancerous lesions.
