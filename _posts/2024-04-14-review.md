### Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (M.Sc.) , University of Göttingen , part 2
# This is the 2th part of my review of the master's courses at the University of Göttingen.
Generally, there isn't much going on in the summer...

1. `Machine Learning (6 C):` It is definitely an important course, full of useful stuff. You need to do exercises (in groups of three people) for the exam, but the exam has nothing to do with them; it is just the math of ML.overall score: 8/10.
2. `Bioinformatik der Systembiologie (12 C):` It is a really great course, containing one course, one seminar in which you need to present a paper, and an internship that you must complete with one of the PhD candidates in the group. Overall score: 9/10.
3. `Deutschkurs: Deutsch - Grundkurs 2 (A1.2.)`: This course is ideal for those who don't speak German. Almost everyone achieves a good grade, but it's categorized as a key competency and doesn't count towards the GPA. Overall score: 6/10.
