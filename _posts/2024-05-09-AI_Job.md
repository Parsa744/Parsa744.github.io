### Evolution ,AI, Feuter of Job market.

some times, overuse of tools can make them useless!

Natural Evolution Example: Rough-Skinned Newt and Garter Snake
In the natural world, the rough-skinned newt evolved to produce a potent toxin called tetrodotoxin (TTX). This initially provided a significant advantage by protecting the newts from predators. However, over time, garter snakes developed resistance to this toxin. This rendered the production of such a strong toxin less effective and ultimately a waste of energy, as it brought no lasting evolutionary benefit.
 
Initial Advantage and Long-term Impact
Artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced powerful tools to enhance job searches, such as creating impressive CVs and motivation letters. Initially, these tools provide a competitive edge for job seekers, enabling them to stand out.

However, as AI tools become widely adopted, their effectiveness diminishes. When everyone uses AI to craft perfect motivation letters, the value of these letters decreases, as they no longer differentiate candidates. This widespread use could make the initial advantage obsolete, turning the reliance on these tools into a potential waste of resources.


Avoiding AI-based tools when applying for a job might be your advantage. Having an authentic, novel, and personalized motivation letter or CV can help you stand out from the crowd.
