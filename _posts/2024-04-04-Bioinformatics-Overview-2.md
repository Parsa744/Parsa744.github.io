## Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (M.Sc.) , University of Göttingen
### This is my review of the master's courses at the University of Göttingen.

1. `Python for Data Science (5 credits):`  This course is too easy if you already know the basics of Python. Despite promises of covering Natural Language Processing (NLP), the topic is barely touched upon—they merely acknowledge its existence. There's no exam; instead, you need to complete a group project with 3 to 6 team members. The course operates on a pass/fail basis. overall score: 5/10.

2. `Biology for Bioinformatics (12 credits):` This course is designed to be as comprehensive as a bachelor's degree in biology, so it's challenging. The teaching rotates among ten or more professors, each covering different sections. The exam encompasses material from over a thousand slides, making it quite difficult. Overall score: 4/10.

3. `German 01 (6 credits):` This course is ideal for those who don't speak German. Almost everyone achieves a good grade, but it's categorized as a key competency and doesn't count towards the GPA. Overall score: 6/10.

4. `Bioinformatics and Its Areas of Application (8 credits):` This course offers a nice overview of bioinformatics for those unfamiliar with the field. Attendance isn't mandatory, and you're required to submit a protocol at the end of the semester, which seemingly goes unread. Overall score: 7/10.

5. `Lecture Series "Genome Science I":` A delightful series where researchers discuss their work, accompanied by pizza. Attendance isn't checked, but I recommend it to learn more about research groups for potential master's thesis collaborations.  Overall score: 7.5/10.
