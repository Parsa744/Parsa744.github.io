### Detailed Three-Year Ph.D. Plan: Bioinformatics (ML & Multi-omics)
## This plan is tailored to your interests in Bayesian Methods, Reinforcement Learning, and Image Segmentation, providing a clear roadmap for your Ph.D. journey.

# Year 1: Foundation, Specialization, and Proposal
# The primary goal of this year is to build your core knowledge base, identify a specific research problem, and write a solid thesis proposal.

Quarter	Focus Area	Specific Actions & Milestones	Deliverables & Metrics
Q1 (Months 1-3)	Broad Learning & Onboarding	- Settle in and meet your advisor and lab members. <br>- Take core required courses (e.g., Advanced Bioinformatics, ML for Bio, Statistics). <br>- Begin a broad literature review across ML, multi-omics, and your specific interests (Bayesian, RL, image segmentation). <br>- Set up your computational environment (Git, Anaconda, PyTorch/TensorFlow).	- A detailed document summarizing your initial literature review.<br>- A working Git repository on GitHub for personal projects.<br>- A clear understanding of your program's Ph.D. requirements.
Q2 (Months 4-6)	Skill Specialization & Exploration	- Take courses and tutorials for your side interests: Bayesian Statistics, Probabilistic Graphical Models, and a Computer Vision course. <br>- Find a small, image-based bioinformatics dataset (e.g., microscopy images of cells) and start a mini-project on image segmentation (e.g., using a U-Net model). <br>- Meet with potential thesis committee members and discuss your interests.	- A successful image segmentation mini-project (e.g., a Jupyter notebook with analysis).<br>- Initial draft of a one-page research statement or a high-level thesis outline.<br>- A clear path for your next-quarter courses and self-study.
Q3 (Months 7-9)	Problem Definition & Proposal Drafting	- Identify a specific, novel research problem at the intersection of multi-omics and your specialized ML skills. For example, "Bayesian Multi-omics Integration for Robust Cell Type Deconvolution in Spatial Transcriptomics." <br>- Begin drafting your thesis proposal. Focus on the introduction, problem statement, and proposed methods. <br>- Start an initial data exploration and preprocessing of the multi-omics dataset you plan to use.	- A complete, detailed thesis proposal draft (e.g., 10-15 pages).<br>- Preliminary data analysis figures.<br>- First meeting with your thesis committee to get feedback on the proposal.
Q4 (Months 10-12)	Finalizing Proposal & Transition to Research	- Address feedback from your advisor and committee on the proposal. <br>- Begin writing the code for your core model's foundation. <br>- Formally submit and defend your thesis proposal. <br>- Begin a deeper dive into the RL literature, looking for parallels in biological systems (e.g., gene network optimization).	- Approved and signed thesis proposal.<br>- A clean, well-structured code repository for your core project.<br>- A literature summary on how RL can be applied to biological problems.

# Year 2: Execution & Research Contribution
# This year is dedicated to the core research of your Ph.D. and the development of your primary publication.

Quarter	Focus Area	Specific Actions & Milestones	Deliverables & Metrics
Q5 (Months 13-15)	Core Model Development	- Develop the main architecture of your multi-omics integration model. <br>- Implement key components, such as a GNN for omics data or an autoencoder for dimensionality reduction. <br>- Begin initial experiments and benchmarking against traditional methods.	- A functional model trained on a small-scale dataset.<br>- Initial performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, loss curves).<br>- A clear plan for scaling up to larger datasets.
Q6 (Months 16-18)	Advanced Method Integration	- Integrate one of your specialized methods. For example, add a Bayesian layer to your model to estimate uncertainty in its predictions. <br>- Perform in-depth analyses to show the value of this approach (e.g., providing confidence scores for cell type assignments). <br>- Work closely with a biological collaborator to ensure your findings are biologically meaningful.	- A revised model that incorporates a Bayesian component.<br>- Figures showing uncertainty quantification.<br>- A first draft of the "Methods" section of your paper.
Q7 (Months 19-21)	Data Analysis & Results Generation	- Scale your model to the full dataset and generate final results. <br>- Create all publication-quality figures and tables. <br>- Begin writing the "Results" and "Discussion" sections of your manuscript. <br>- Prepare a poster for a small, local conference or a departmental talk.	- All key figures for your publication.<br>- A complete draft of the "Results" and "Discussion" sections.<br>- A finalized poster presentation.
Q8 (Months 22-24)	Paper Submission & Dissemination	- Finalize your manuscript with your advisor and co-authors. <br>- Submit your paper to a top-tier journal (e.g., Nature Methods, Cell Systems). <br>- Give a talk or present your poster at a national/international conference (e.g., ISMB, RECOMB).	- A submitted, first-author paper.<br>- A successful conference presentation.<br>- A polished, public-facing summary of your research.
